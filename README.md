## About

A typst package to easily write maths and computer sciences. Its name is based on **M**ath **I**nfo **Docs**, *info* being an abbreviation of *informatique*, which stands for computer science in French. 

By design, this project is opiniated and may not reflect the way you write your typst documents. Depending on my needs, it may focus less on maths for now.

## Features

This package provides documents templates alongside useful macros allowing the writing of document structured like LaTeX. *Documentation, examples and tests will come at some point* 

## Installing

No release is planned yet. You can install it locally by cloning this repository and typing `just install`. You can uninstall with `just uninstall`.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
